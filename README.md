When the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was organized in a small town in New York in 1830, there were only six members. Today, the Mormon Church has grown to over [16 million members](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/04/06/lds-church-tops-million/), with congregations in [160 countries](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/01/news-of-the-church/church-growing-in-more-than-160-countries?lang=eng).

Leaders of the church have [taught](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/10/the-stone-cut-out-of-the-mountain?lang=eng) that this extraordinary growth is fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy. [Daniel 2:31–45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng) describes a stone “cut out of the mountain without hands” which would roll forth to fill the whole earth. Like the stone, the Church is prophesied to spread to and fill "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.” (See [D&C 42:58](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng))

Given the ambitious scope of that prophecy, it’s no wonder that many parties, inside and outside the organization, are interested in measuring and tracking the growth of the LDS Church. While [high-level membership metrics](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics) are shared bi-annually by church leadership, country or state-specific trends are not provided. **This project is an attempt to more precisely measure church growth by tracking changes in the number and distribution of meetinghouses and wards<sup>1</sup> over time.**

*<sup>1</sup>Wards are the basic organizational unit of the Church, e.g., a congregation.*
